# Getting Started with Create React App

Developed a responsive fitness website using React JS: Created a dynamic fitness website that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, allowing users to access it on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Integrated external API for exercise data: Utilized the Rapid API to retrieve exercise information for all body parts, providing users with a comprehensive collection of exercises to target specific muscle groups. This integration adds depth and variety to the website's content.

Displayed exercise videos and categorized exercises: Incorporated YouTube videos related to each exercise, enriching the user experience with visual guidance. Additionally, implemented categorization of exercises into "with equipment" and "without equipment," allowing users to choose exercises based on their available resources.

Leveraged React Router for smooth navigation: Utilized React Router to create a multi-page website experience, enabling users to easily navigate between different sections of the fitness website. This enhances usability and improves overall user engagement.

Utilized pagination for efficient content browsing: Implemented pagination to organize and present exercise information in a user-friendly manner, enabling users to browse through exercises more efficiently. This feature enhances the overall usability and convenience of the website.

Enhanced UI with Material UI: Incorporated Material UI, a popular React UI component library, to improve the visual aesthetics and user interface of the fitness website. This choice enhances the overall user experience by providing a polished and consistent design throughout the application.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
